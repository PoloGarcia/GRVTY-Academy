## Our Current Structure for Github Issues:
We follow a simple convention for our Github issues. We do not declare definition of done for every issue since we have one set for all issues. Our **DOD** needs an issue to be Unit-Tested, Documented and Peer Reviewed.

**Issue Title:** High level summary for the JTBD. Optimize the title for team understanding.

**Issue Description:**
  - **When / Situation**: What happens in the users context that makes the user want to do an action.
  - **User Motivation**: What the users want to solve for in order to maximize a gain or reduce a pain.
  - **So that:** What does the user expect to be able to do.
  - **Expected Outcome:** What would the user consider a successful outcome.
  
  - **Tasks:** Details on activities related to the task. E.G. Design Screen.
  
  -**AC:** Acceptance Criteria
  
**Issue Title:** Michael is hungry at the theatre's queue and doesn't want to stand in line again to grab food.

**Issue Description:**
  - **When / Situation**: When Michael is in line at the Movie-theatre for a film premiere and is feeling hungry.
  - **User Motivation**: Michael wants to pre-order for and pick it up inmediately.
